## Description
This is a functional backend for a generic ecommerce site. It uses MySQL and Sequelize to handle the database, and Express.js to handle API routes and the server.
    

## Installation
You will need Node and MySQL on your machine to run this code, so make sure you set those up first. After you download the code from this repository, you will need to open your CLI and enter the command 'npm i' to install the necessary dependancies. After this, open your MySQL shell and run the command 'source db/schema.sql' to create the database. In your local repository, create a '.env' file, and save your MySQL username, password, and ecommerce_db as DB_USER, DB_PW, and DB_NAME respectively. This file will give you access to the database through sequelize, so it is very important. After this, run the command 'npm run seed' in your CLI to seed the database if you wish, and the command 'npm start' to start the server. Please refer to the video below for a demonstration.
    

## Usage
Please refer to the following video for a demonstration of the server:
